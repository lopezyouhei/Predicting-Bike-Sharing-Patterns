# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns
The repository uses simple MLP (multi layer perceptrons) to predict the amount of bikes a bike rental company needs to buy to ensure that they find the right balance of bicycles in-store and the rental demand. This is a project from the Udacity Nanodegree course Deep Learning.
